Amanda_D,"February 19, 2026","Bought two of these for my kids awhile back. These are great when traveling by plane. My kids can pack all their stuff in these and they counted as their personal item when flying. For example, my daughter was able to fit two swimsuits, 4 outfits, sleepwear, toothbrush, chargers, her table, and extra pair of shoes in hers and still had some extra room. The quality is amazing."
Chonnn,"February 18, 2026",Love the color. Love the size. So many pockets and areas to store things. Fits under the seat of the plane perfectly. Bought this for my daughter because she needed a carry on. Thinking I should have got one for me too. Nice quality and super cute. The strap on back is perfect to slide right onto your luggage.
Amazon Customer,"February 22, 2026","I bought this bag last minute before my travel since I didn’t have a check in luggage in my ticket.I got the large size and when it arrived I was doubtful how much it would fit since I had a lot of stuff.To my surprise, it was able to accommodate an all my stuff and was still light on my shoulders!The quality is amazing, there is lots of space, the zips and compartments are well made! I had liquids, clothes and tons of other stuff and it all fit perfectly and did not get crushed!I’m so amazed by the quality for this price!"
sandra smith,"February 7, 2026","This is an amazing bag for travel , work etc.  I waited a bit to review until I had used it. I took it on a flight and right away realized how spacious and perfect this bag is . There are 3 different zippers for the 3 pockets. The small one in front has some pockets as well, the middle one again has more pockets, is useful for documents, laptop etc. The last one has 2 good sized mesh pockets on one side and straps on the other side making it great for a quick weekend getaway as well ☺️. Don’t hesitate to… get this . Extra bonus that it’s a backpack and no need to lug on your arm. Oh and water bottle holder on the side!"
Kritzia Lopez,"February 25, 2026","Exactly as depicted in the image and description. Spacious and comfortable for travel. Materials feel strong and durable, and the color is very pretty. Comes with the charging port connection, and the straps are secure."
M MADSON,"January 5, 2026","This backpack/bag is huge! It has one pocket for your laptop or tablet, and then the rest of it is an open area with no pockets at all, which can be a pain if you carry a lot of items like I do. I use this for work, we don't have places to keep items there, so I have to haul everything back and forth. I solved the pocket problem by using my packing cubes for the loose items I carry with me, pens, pencils, crossword and other books, the usual things you might need at work. If it had pockets, it would get a 5 star rating.The zippers are sturdy and slide smoothly, the attached handles are strong. The backpack straps are stitched well and look to be durable, but I've only had this about a week, so I can't really speak to the durability factor.If you use this for traveling, you could probably get away with packing for a weekend using just the bag, the open side is spacious enough to handle clothing, and there is an included wet bag that you could use for shoes if you weren't using it for anything wet. It will definitely fit in the overhead compartment so you an avoid checking the bag too. I wish I'd had this bag for my cruise, it would have been great for embarkation day.I'm sure that you can find many uses for the backpack/bag as I have. It is a good deal for the money I paid, it's sturdy and relatively lightweight. so the bag isn't adding any bulk to what you're carrying. It is a good size for any thing you might want to carry in it. I use my 12"" iPad at work, and it fits just fine with room to spare. I also carry 2 liter bottles of soda in it and it's fine. The straps are wide enough that it distributes the weight of what you're carrying very well. My old backpack didn't do that. Overall I am satisfied with the backpack, if there are any issues, I will update the review."
Astghik Ohanyan,"January 12, 2026","I have used many travel backpacks designed for travel and short trips and the thing that annoys me the most is how uncomfortable the straps are on my back! One of the first things I noticed were the pads on the straps, even my brother tested it out and claimed it's comfortable and soft. Has various pockets for fitting in accessories, travel documents, wallets, makeup bags, jewelry bags, a pouch for your shoes, a charger port case which is PERFECT, it even has space for my laptop! I think it's user friendly in terms of accessibility and comfort and you can't beat the price- 24 bucks! I got the LARGE size just for reference. Thanks for creating such a handy travel backpack."
happykbd26,"February 5, 2026","Absolutely a great buy!  Can fit so much while keeping you qualified for a personal item while even on the most stringent airline.. spirit! Functionality and travelability 100% approved. The backpack is well secure and kept with you, easy to pop in an overhead or under the seat. When empty, it can fold flat for storage until your next travel adventure."
